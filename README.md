# Job Recruitment

Welcome to the Job Recruitment project! This project aims to connect employers and job seekers with each other through the project web interface.

Employers can create, delete, edit job postings and manage their applications to job postings.

Job seekers can apply for suitable jobs, view their application status, and withdraw their applications through the project web interface.
